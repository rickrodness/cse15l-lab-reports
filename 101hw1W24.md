### PROBLEM 1 (10 points)

*[The purpose of this problem is to review asymptotic notation, recurrence relations, and induction.]*

Let \( T \) be defined by the recurrence relation:

\[ T(0) = 0, \quad T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 2^n \text{ for all } n \geq 1 \]

(a) Prove that \( T(n) = \Omega(2^n) \) using induction.
(b) Prove that \( T(n) = O(3^n) \) using induction.




#### (a) Proving \( T(n) = \Omega(2^n) \):

**Base Case (n=1):**
The recurrence relation tells us \( T(1) = 2T(0) + 2^1 \). Since \( T(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( T(1) = 2 \). We need to find a constant \( c \) such that \( T(1) \geq c \cdot 2^1 \). We can choose \( c = 1 \) and the inequality holds because \( T(1) = 2 \geq 1 \cdot 2^1 \) thus our base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume the relation holds for some \( k \geq 1 \), meaning \( T(k) \geq c \cdot 2^k \). To complete the inductive step, we must show that \( T(k+1) \geq c \cdot 2^{k+1} \). Using the recurrence, we find \( T(k+1) = 2T(k) + 2^{k+1} \). Assuming our inductive hypothesis is correct, we get \( T(k+1) \geq 2(c \cdot 2^k) + 2^{k+1} \) which simplifies to \( T(k+1) \geq c \cdot 2^{k+1} + 2^{k+1} \), and since \( c \leq 1 \), it follows that \( T(k+1) \geq c \cdot 2^{k+1} \).  Thus, by induction \( T(n) = \Omega(2^n) \) for \( c = 1 \).

#### (b) Proving \( T(n) = O(3^n) \):

**Base Case (n=1):**
We know \( T(1) \) using the recurrence relation, yields \( T(1) = 2 \). We want a constant \( C \) such that \( T(1) \leq C \cdot 3^1 \). If we choose \( C = 2 \), then \( T(1) = 2 \leq 2 \cdot 3 \), and our base case is satisfied.

**Inductive Step:**
Suppose \( T(k) \leq C \cdot 3^k \) for some \( k \geq 1 \) . We need to show that \( T(k+1) \leq C \cdot 3^{k+1} \). From the recurrence relation, we have \( T(k+1) = 2T(k) + 2^{k+1} \). Using the inductive hypothesis, we get \( T(k+1) \leq 2(C \cdot 3^k) + 2^{k+1} \). We know  \( k \) and \( C \), \( 2^{k+1} \) can be bounded by \( C \cdot 3^k \), thus \( T(k+1) \leq 3C \cdot 3^k \), which simplifies to \( T(k+1) \leq C \cdot 3^{k+1} \). By induction, we have shown that \( T(n) = O(3^n) \) for an appropriate choice of \( C \).


Thus, we have proven through mathematical induction that \( T(n) \) is both at least as large as \( 2^n \) and at most as large as \( 3^n \), giving us the bounds \( T(n) = \Omega(2^n) \) and \( T(n) = O(3^n) \).

### PROBLEM 2 (14 points)

*Note: [This problem provides an example of a graph with \( n \) vertices that has exponentially many paths between two of its vertices, highlighting the computational complexity of searching all paths. It's noted that depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are polynomial-time algorithms that do not enumerate all paths.]*

Let \( T(n) \) be the \( n \)th triangle chain graph, defined recursively as:

- \( T(0) \) is a single vertex \( A_0 \).
- For \( n > 0 \), \( T(n) \) includes graph \( T(n-1) \) plus two new vertices \( A_n, B_n \) and directed edges \( (A_n, B_n), (B_n, A_{n-1}), (A_n, A_{n-1}) \).



*a. Determine the number of vertices in \( T(n) \) using a recurrence relation.*
*b. Determine the number of edges in \( T(n) \) using a recurrence relation.*
*c. Calculate the number of different paths from \( A_n \) to \( A_0 \) in \( T(n) \) using a recurrence relation.*
   - Example: For \( T(2) \), enumerate the paths from \( A_2 \) to \( A_0 \)

d. Define \( P(N) \) as the number of paths from one side to the other in a triangle chain graph with \( N \) vertices. Establish the big-Theta notation for \( P(N) \) and justify your answer.

#### (a) Number of Vertices in \( T(n) \):

To determine the number of vertices in the triangle chain graph \( T(n) \), we set up a recurrence relation. For the base case, \( T(0) \), we have a single vertex \( A_0 \). Therefore, \( V(0) = 1 \). For any \( n > 0 \), the graph \( T(n) \) is formed by adding two new vertices to the previous graph \( T(n-1) \), which gives us the recurrence relation:

\[ V(n) = V(n-1) + 2 \]

To solve this recurrence, we can simply expand it:

\[ V(n) = V(n-1) + 2 = (V(n-2) + 2) + 2 = ... = V(0) + 2n \]

Since \( V(0) = 1 \), the solution is:

\[ V(n) = 1 + 2n \]

Thus, the graph \( T(n) \) has \( 1 + 2n \) vertices. 

##### (b) Number of Edges in \( T(n) \):

Similarly, we can find the number of edges in \( T(n) \) using a recurrence relation. For \( T(0) \) there are no edges, so \( E(0) = 0 \). For each additional \( T(n) \), we add three new edges: one connecting the new vertex \( A_n \) to \( B_n \), and two connecting \( A_n \) and \( B_n \) to \( T(n-1) \). This gives us the recurrence relation:

\[ E(n) = E(n-1) + 3 \]

Solving this recurrence shows it's a sum of a constant number of edges added at each step:

\[ E(n) = E(0) + 3n = 3n \]

Thus, \( T(n) \) has \( 3n \) edges.

##### (c) Different Paths from \( A_n \) to \( A_0 \) in \( T(n) \):

To find the number of different paths from \( A_n \) to \( A_0 \) in \( T(n) \) we can also use a recurrence relation. From \( A_1 \) to \( A_0 \), there's clearly only 1 path, so \( P(1) = 1 \). For each increase in \( n \), every path that leads to \( A_{n-1} \) adds to two paths to \( A_n \) one directly and one through \( B_n \). Therefore, the number of paths doubles with each increase in \( n \):

\[ P(n) = 2P(n-1) \]

With this, we can express the number of paths as a power of 2:

\[ P(n) = 2^{n-1} \]

Thus, there are \( 2^{n-1} \) different paths from \( A_n \) to \( A_0 \) in \( T(n) \).

**(d) Big-Theta Bound of \( P(N) \):**

Given \( N = 1 + 2n \) vertices in \( T(n) \) we know that the number of paths from \( A_n \) to \( A_0 \) is \( 2^{n-1} \), we can find the big-Theta bound for \( P(N) \). As \( n \) is approximately \( N/2 \) (if we ignore the constant 1 for large \( N \)), the number of paths \( P(N) \) can be expressed as:

\[ P(N) \approx 2^{(N/2) - 1} \]

This simplifies to \( 2^{N/2} / 2 \), which grows exponentially with \( N \). Therefore, the big-Theta bound of \( P(N) \) is:

\[ P(N) = \Theta(2^{N/2}) \]

### PROBLEM 3 (10 points)

*Note: [The main motivation for this problem is to explore the transformation of data from a matrix to a graph to apply graph algorithms, understand the potential size of the graph, and consider adaptations for additional constraints.]*

Suppose you have an \( n \times n \) board game represented by a matrix with values in \( \{0,1,2\} \), where landing on a '0' traps you, a '1' allows movement to an adjacent square, and a '2' allows a two-square move in the cardinal directions. You want to determine if it's possible to travel from the top-left to the bottom-right corner following these rules.


1. To design a graph from the \( n \times n \) matrix:
   - **Vertices**: Each non-'0' cell . 
   - **Edges**: Connect vertices if the move is valid according to the cell's value; '1' connects to adjacent cells, and '2' connects to cells two steps away. 
   - **Directed or Undirected**: Edges are directed and go one-way from one cell to the next.

2. In the worst case:
   - **Vertices**: Maximum \( n^2 \) if there are no '0' cells.
   - **Edges**: Up to \( 4n^2 \) if all cells are '1's, each connecting to four neighbors; or up to \( 8n^2 \) if all cells are '2's => two-step moves in each direction. 

3. To determine the possibility of travel:
   - **Algorithm**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS), starting from the top-left corner and proceeding to the bottom-right. BFS is suitable for unweighted graphs and finds the shortest path without exhaustive path enumeration. 

No detailed proof or algorithm runtime analysis is required.

### PROBLEM 4 (10 points)

*Note: [The aim here is to understand reduction algorithms and practice bi-directional proofs in decision problems.]*

**Given:**
A directed graph \( G \) with vertex weights \( w_v \in \{0, 1\} \), and designated vertices \( s \) (weight 0) and \( t \) (weight 1)

**Task:**
Determine if a path exists from \( s \) to \( t \) in \( G \) that forms a binary sequence of weights \( 0^n1^m \) for any \( m, n \geq 1 \)

**Algorithm Description:**
1. Input: A graph \( G \) with vertices labeled 0 or 1, vertex \( s \) labeled 0, and vertex \( t \) labeled 1
2. Modify \( G \) to create \( G' \) by removing edges from 1-labeled vertices to 0-labeled vertices
3. Perform graph search on \( G' \) from \( s \)
4. If \( t \) is reached, return **TRUE**, otherwise return **FALSE**

**Proof Requirement:**
Demonstrate the algorithm's accuracy by showing it returns **TRUE** for inputs with the desired property and **FALSE** otherwise, using a bi-directional proof


#### Bi-Directional Proof:

**(→)**
If there is a path from `s` to `t` in the original graph `G` following the pattern `0ⁿ1ᵐ`, then `G'` will keep this path since no edge in this path goes from a `1` to a `0`. Running graphsearch on `G'` will visit `t` starting from `s`, and the algorithm will return **TRUE**.

**(←)**
If the algorithm returns **TRUE**, graphsearch found a path from `s` to `t` in `G'`. Because of `G`, this path cannot have edges going from `1` to `0`. Therefore, the path in `G'` must follow the pattern `0ⁿ1ᵐ`, starting with a sequence of `0`s followed by a sequence of `1`s.


Thus the algorithm is correct and will only return **TRUE** if a path exists in `G` that follows the required binary sequence pattern. If no path exists, or if the pattern is broken (like a `1` followed by a `0`), the algorithm will correctly return **FALSE**.
  
  --- 

**First Graph**: There is no path from `s` to `t` following `0ⁿ1ᵐ`. The algorithm will correctly remove edges that disrupt the pattern and thus will not find a valid path, returning **FALSE**.
**Second Graph**: There is a valid path `s, D, C, A, t` following `0ⁿ1ᵐ`. The algorithm will find this path after the modification, and return **TRUE**.

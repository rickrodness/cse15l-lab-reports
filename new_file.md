We can also write in italics:  _Very Cool_ 
## Remote Access and Filesystem

1.  The working directory was /home when running the command
ls we got the result lecture1 because the ls command lists all the files in current directory, 
cd we got nothing because we are already inside the root directory named home
cat allows for us to read and write directly to a file, it did not do anything because we fed it zero arguments.
